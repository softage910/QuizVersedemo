            <h2 className="h2">Right-Click Functionality</h2>
            <p>
                One of the first adjustments is learning how to perform a right-click on a Mac. Hold down the <strong>Control</strong> key while clicking. For trackpad users, a two-finger tap acts as a right-click. Magic Mouse users must enable right-click in system settings.

            <h2 className="h2">Navigating the Dock and Launchpad</h2>
            <p>
                The Mac Dock functions similarly to the Windows taskbar, allowing you to pin frequently used apps. Applications on your Mac can be accessed via Launchpadâ€”reminiscent of an iPhone home screen. Customize the Dock by dragging apps in or out; the right side of the Dock shows recently opened apps, and the Trash icon also serves as an ejector for external drives.

            <h2 className="h2">Notification Center and Control Center</h2>
            <p>
                The Notification Center on Macs combines features of Window&apos;s notification area and widgets. Access notifications and personalize widgets by swiping from the right edge of the trackpad or clicking the time in the top right corner. The Control Center offers quick access to settings like sound, brightness, and network connections.

            <h2 className="h2">Spotlight Search</h2>
            <p>
                For searching, macOS offers Spotlight. Press <strong>Command + Spacebar</strong> to reveal a powerful search bar that finds apps, files, and even performs calculations or currency conversions.

            <h2 className="h2">Using Finder</h2>
            <p>
                Finder is the Mac equivalent of Windows File Explorer. Although it may seem confusing at first, enabling the path bar shows your location in the file system. You can pin important folders in the sidebar and toggle between different viewing modes for better file management.

            <h2 className="h2">Window Management and App Switching</h2>
            <p>
                Macs offer unique methods for managing and switching between apps:
                <br /><strong>Command + Tab:</strong> Switch between open apps.
                <br /><strong>Command + Tilde:</strong> Cycle through windows of the same app.
                <br /><strong>Mission Control:</strong> View all open windows with F3 or a three-finger swipe up.
                <br /><strong>Stage Manager:</strong> Organize windows more efficiently.
            </p>
            <hr />


            <h2 className="h2">Closing Applications</h2>
            <p>
                Unlike Windows, clicking the red X on a Mac only closes the window. To fully quit an app, select <strong>Quit</strong> from the menu bar or press <strong>Command + Q</strong>. For unresponsive apps, use the Force Quit option in the Apple menu.
            </p>

            <h2 className="h2">Scroll Bars</h2>
            <p>
                By default, scroll bars appear only during scrolling. If you prefer them always visible, adjust this setting in System Preferences for a consistent display.
            </p>
