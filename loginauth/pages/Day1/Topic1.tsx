            <p>
                In the context of AI model training, data refers to the raw material, often in the form of text, numbers, images, audio, video or other signals, from which an AI system learns patterns and relationships. Data is the foundational input that allows machine learning and deep learning models to adjust their internal parameters so that they can make predictions, perform classification tasks, generate content, or take any other actions.

                In short, it serves as the “textbook” for AI systems, which in turn, helps them to generalize knowledge to new, unseen scenarios. Without data, models cannot identify correlations or refine decision-making processes.
