                    Definition This is the &quot;00:00&quot; point of every video—where your system is

                            Occasionally, have several applications open, whether they&apos;re
                            overlapping or in the background. This diversity helps create more
                            varied and realistic recordings.

                            Use different datasets or arrange your windows in various layouts. The
                            goal is to mimic real users environments. For instance, starting with a
                            blank projects page or with only one project visible doesn&apos;t represent
                            someone who frequently uses the tool. Refer to Section 4 for more
                            details.

                            Avoid Repeating the Same Environment. Try not to begin every
                            recording in the exact same setup. Mixing things up ensures that ACE is
                            exposed to a wide range of starting points.

                <li>
                If you&apos;re doing something that requires full-screen mode (e.g., a design app
that only works maximized), thats acceptable. Otherwise, vary it to show
ACE different possible starting points.
