                precise recordings of tasks to train ACE, our computer control agent. As a data
                creator, youll play a key role in shaping ACE into the best computer control
                agent.
                These guidelines are designed to help you understand our goals and
                processes. We encourage you to read “Introduction to Fluxe and “Introduction
                to Engine along with this guideline to understand the process thoroughly.
                These guidelines are broken into 11 key sections, each addressing an essential
                aspect of the recording process.
