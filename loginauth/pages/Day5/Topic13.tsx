                            Optimal actions are your goal while performing recordings to train ACE.

                            When executing tasks, aim to follow the shortest and most natural path. For
                            example, if an action can be completed with 3 clicks instead of 5, choose
                            the 3-click method. This efficiency helps ACE learn more effectively.

                            Incorporate Keyboard shortcuts wherever necessary. This step also
                            ensures that you take a more reliable path while recording.

                            Let us demonstrate the importance of Optimal Actions and Keyboard Shortcuts
                            with this example:
                        </p>

                            To archive the highlighted card on this Trello board, you have two options:
                        </li>
                        <br />
                        <figure className='img-5-3'>
                            <img src='../images/5.3.png'/>
                        </figure>


                        <br />
                        <li>
                            Right-Click Method Right-click the card and select Archive from the
                            dropdown menu.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Keyboard Shortcut Press the &quot;C&quot; key on your keyboard to archive the card
                            instantly.
                        </li>

                        <p>
                            Which method is more optimal?
                            Using the keyboard shortcut (&quot;C&quot;) is the more efficient way to archive a card.
                            It reduces the number of clicks and speeds up your workflow, and ACE also
                            needs to learn that!
                        </p>

                        <li>
                        Resolutions Use the &quot;default resolution&quot; setting while recording.
Additionally, vary between windowed and full-screen modes occasionally
to provide diverse data.

                        Why Exposing ACE to different screen layouts helps it learn to navigate
                        consistently across various setups and configurations.

                        <li>
                        Minimize Unnecessary Movement: Keep your mouse movements steady
and avoid dragging it around the screen unnecessarily. This helps create
clean recordings that are easy to follow and reduces potential confusion or
lag/noise.

                        Acceptable Waits If a task inherently takes a few seconds to process (e.g.,
loading a file), its okay to wait in the recording. Use your judgment to
ensure that the final video remains clean and free of unnecessary delays.
