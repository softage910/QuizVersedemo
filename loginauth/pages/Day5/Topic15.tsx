                Use "test" or "fake" data in apps like Canva, Asana, and others to make
your screen look authentic and varied. Having multiple files with realsounding names in your boards, projects, and workspaces helps ACE
understand the dynamic nature of different users patterns and habits.

            <ol className='ol'>
                <li>
                    Each tool you work with will be labeled with a tag in the format "tool-
                    (tool_name)", and the tasks you perform will be tagged as "op-
                    (tool_name)-(feature_name)". For example:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <ul className='ul'>
                        <li>
                            If you're recording a task using the Background Removal Tool in Adobe
                            Photoshop, the tags would be "tool-ps" and "op-ps-backgroundremoval".
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For a task like Formatting in Google Sheets, the tags would be "toolsheets" and "op-sheets-formatting".
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multiple Tags per Tool : A single tool may have numerous tags based on its features. For instance, if
                    a tool has 85 features, there will be 85 unique tags representing each
                    feature.

                </li>


                <li>
                    Refer to Introduction to Fluxe.pdf to understand the process of choosing
                    tags in Fluxe.
