            <ol className="ol">
                <li><strong>Hyper-personalization:</strong> Future prompting will move beyond generic interactions to highly personalized experiences. AI agents will leverage user data, including past interactions, interests, and preferences, to tailor responses and provide more relevant and engaging experiences. Imagine agents that anticipate your needs based on your history and context, making interactions feel truly personalized.</li>
                <li><strong>Contextual understanding:</strong> Enhanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) will enable AI agents to grasp context with greater nuance. Prompts will be interpreted not just as isolated requests, but within the broader context of the conversation. This will lead to more accurate, relevant, and natural-feeling interactions, mirroring human conversations more closely.</li>
                <li><strong>Multimodal integration:</strong> The future of prompting will extend beyond text. AI agents will be able to process and integrate multiple input modalities, including voice, images, and even video.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced learning efficiency:</strong> Techniques like few-shot and zero-shot learning are constantly improving. This means AI agents will be able to learn and adapt from fewer examples, requiring less training data to achieve high performance. This will help models generalize their knowledge to new tasks and environments with minimal additional training.</li>
